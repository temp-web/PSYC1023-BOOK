<h5 class="mume-header" id="q-111-how-do-psychologists-define-a-psychological-disorder">Q 1.1.1 How do psychologists define a psychological disorder?</h5>

<ul>
<li>A psychological disorder is (1) a psychological dysfunction that is (2) associated with distress or impairment in functioning and (3) a response that is not typical or culturally expected. All three basic criteria must be met; no one criterion alone has yet been identified that defines the essence of abnormality.</li>
<li>Psychopathology is concerned with the scientific study of psychological disorders. Mental health professionals range from clinical and counseling psychologists to psychiatrists and psychiatric social workers and nurses. Each profession requires a specific type of training.</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="mume-header" id="q-112-what-is-a-scientist-practitioner">Q 1.1.2 What is a scientist-practitioner?</h5>

<ul>
<li>Mental health professionals can function as scientist-practitioners. They not only keep up with the latest findings but also use scientific data to evaluate their own work, and they often conduct research within their clinics or hospitals.</li>
<li>Research about psychological disorders falls into three categories: description, causation, and treatment and outcomes.</li>

<h5 class="mume-header" id="q-122-what-are-the-underlying-assumptions-of-the-biological-approach-to-understanding-abnormal-behavior">Q 1.2.2 What are the underlying assumptions of the biological approach to understanding abnormal behavior?</h5>

<h5 class="mume-header" id="q-123-how-do-the-psychological-approaches-of-psychoanalysis-humanism-and-behaviorism-explain-abnormal-behavior">Q 1.2.3 How do the psychological approaches of psychoanalysis, humanism, and behaviorism explain abnormal behavior?</h5>

<ul>
<li>Historically, there have been three approaches to abnormal behavior. In the supernatural tradition, abnormal behavior is attributed to outside agents, such as demons or spirits. In the biological tradition, disorders are attributed to disease or biochemical imbalances; in the psychological tradition, abnormal behavior is attributed to faulty psychological development and to social context.</li>
<li>Each tradition has its own ways of treating individuals. Supernatural treatments include exorcism to rid the body of the supernatural spirits. Biological treatments emphasize physical care and medical cures, especially drugs. Psychological approaches use psychosocial treatments, beginning with moral therapy and including modern psychotherapy.</li>
<li>Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalytic therapy, offered an elaborate conception of the unconscious mind. In therapy, Freud focused on tapping into the unconscious through such techniques as catharsis, free association, and dream analysis. Although Freud&#x2019;s followers veered from his path in many ways, Freud&#x2019;s influence can still be felt today.</li>
<li>One outgrowth of Freudian therapy is humanistic psychology, which focuses on human potential and self-actualizing. Therapy that has evolved from this approach is known as person-centered therapy; the therapist shows almost unconditional positive regard for the client&#x2019;s feelings and thoughts.</li>
<li>The behavioral model moved psychology into the realm of science. Both research and therapy focus on things that are measurable, including such techniques as systematic desensitization, reinforcement, and shaping.</li>

<ul>
<li>With the increasing sophistication of our scientific tools, and new knowledge from cognitive science, behavioral science, and neuroscience, we now realize that no contribution to psychological disorders occurs in isolation. Our behavior, both normal and abnormal, is a product of a continual interaction of psychological, biological, and social influences.</li>

<h5 class="mume-header" id="q-211-what-are-clinical-assessment-and-diagnosis">Q 2.1.1 What are clinical assessment and diagnosis?</h5>

<ul>
<li>Clinical assessment is the systematic evaluation and measurement of psychological, biological, and social factors in an individual with a possible psychological disorder; diagnosis is the process of determining that those factors meet all criteria for a specific psychological disorder.</li>
<li>Reliability, validity, and standardization are important components in determining the value of a psychological assessment.</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="mume-header" id="q-212-what-are-the-main-methods-used-in-clinical-assessment">Q 2.1.2 What are the main methods used in clinical assessment?</h5>

<ul>
<li>To assess various aspects of psychological disorders, clinicians may first interview and take an informal mental status exam of the patient. More systematic observations of behavior are called behavioral assessments.</li>
<li>A variety of psychological tests can be used during the assessment, including projective tests, in which the patient responds to ambiguous stimuli by projecting unconscious thoughts; personality inventories, in which the patient takes a self-report questionnaire designed to assess personal traits; and intelligence testing, which provides a score known as an intelligence quotient (IQ).</li>
<li>Biological aspects of psychological disorders may be assessed through neuropsychological testing designed to identify possible areas of brain dysfunction. Neuroimaging can be used more directly to identify brain structure and function. Finally, psychophysiological assessment refers to measurable changes in the nervous system, reflecting emotional or psychological events that might be relevant to a psychological disorder.</li>

<h5 class="mume-header" id="q-221-how-is-psychiatric-diagnosis-carried-out">Q 2.2.1 How is psychiatric diagnosis carried out?</h5>

<ul>
<li>The term classification refers to any effort to construct groups or categories and to assign objects or people to the categories on the basis of their shared attributes or relations. Methods of classification include classical categorical, dimensional, and prototypical approaches. Our current system of classification, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fifth edition (DSM-5), is based on a prototypical approach in which certain essential characteristics are identified but certain &#x201C;non-essential&#x201D; variations do not necessarily change the classification.<br>
The DSM-5 categories are based on empirical findings to identify the criteria for each diagnosis. Although this system is the best to date in terms of scientific underpinnings, it is far from perfect, and research continues on the most useful way to classify psychological disorders.</li>

<h5 class="mume-header" id="q-241-what-methods-are-used-to-conduct-research-on-the-causes-of-behavior">Q 2.4.1 What methods are used to conduct research on the causes of behavior?</h5>

<ul>
<li>The individual case study is used to study one or more individuals in depth. Although case studies have an important role in the theoretical development of psychology, they are not subject to experimental control and must necessarily be suspect in terms of both internal and external validity.</li>
<li>Research by correlation can tell us whether a relationship exists between two variables, but it does not tell us if that relationship is a causal one. Epidemiological research is a type of correlational research that reveals the incidence, distribution, and consequences of a particular problem in one or more populations.</li>
<li>Research by experiment can follow one of two designs: group or single case. In both designs, a variable (or variables) is manipulated and the effects are observed to determine the nature of a causal relationship.</li>

<li>Research strategies that examine psychopathology across time include cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. Both focus on differences in behavior or attitudes at different ages, but the former does so by looking at different individuals at different ages and the latter looks at the same individuals at different ages.</li>
<li>Prevention research can be viewed in four broad categories: health promotion or positive development strategies, universal prevention strategies, selective prevention strategies, and indicated prevention strategies.</li>
<li>The clinical picture, causal factors, and treatment process and outcome can all be influenced by cultural factors.</li>

<ul>
<li>To identify the causes of a psychological disorder in a given person we must consider the interaction of all relevant dimensions: genetic contributions, the role of the nervous system, behavioral and cognitive processes, emotional influences, social and interpersonal influences, and developmental factors. Thus, we have arrived at a multidimensional integrative approach to the causes of psychological disorders.</li>

<h5 class="mume-header" id="q-321-how-do-genes-interact-with-environmental-factors-to-affect-behavior">Q 3.2.1 How do genes interact with environmental factors to affect behavior?</h5>

<ul>
<li>The genetic influence on much of our development and most of our behavior, personality, and even IQ score is polygenic - that is, influenced by many genes. This is assumed to be the case in abnormal behavior as well, although research is beginning to identify specific small groups of genes that relate to some major psychological disorders.</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="mume-header" id="q-322-what-kinds-of-models-have-been-proposed-to-describe-this-interaction">Q 3.2.2 What kinds of models have been proposed to describe this interaction?</h5>

<ul>
<li>In studying causal relationships in psychopathology, researchers look at the interactions of genetic and environmental effects. In the diathesis&#x2013;stress model, individuals are assumed to inherit certain vulnerabilities that make them susceptible to a disorder when the right kind of stressor comes along. In the gene&#x2013;environment correlation or reciprocal gene&#x2013;environment model, the individual&#x2019;s genetic vulnerability toward a certain disorder may make it more likely that the person will experience the stressor that, in turn, triggers the genetic vulnerability and thus the disorder. In epigenetics, the immediate effects of the environment (such as early stressful experiences) influence cells that turn certain genes on or off. This effect may be passed down through several generations.</li>

<ul>
<li>Within the nervous system, levels of neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine activity interact to modulate and regulate emotions and behavior and contribute to psychological disorders. Of the neurotransmitters that may play a key role, we investigated five: serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, norepinephrine, and dopamine.</li>

<ul>
<li>The brain includes the brain stem, which handles most essential automatic functions, and the forebrain. The hindbrain contains the medulla, pons, and cerebellum; it regulates many automatic activities, such as breath-ing. The midbrain coordinates movement. At the top of the brain stem are the thalamus and hypothalamus, which regulate behavior and emotion. The limbic sys-tem includes the hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, septum, and amygdala, which help regulate our emotions and are involved with the basic drives of sex, aggression, hunger, and thirst. The cerebral cortex allows us to plan, reason, and create.</li>

<ul>
<li>The field of cognitive science provides a valuable perspective on how behavioral and cognitive influences affect learning and adaptation. Clearly, such influences not only contribute to psychological disorders but also may modify brain functioning, brain structure, and even genetic expression. We examined some research in this field by looking at learned helplessness, modeling, prepared learning, and implicit memory.</li>

<ul>
<li>Mood disorders are among the most common psychological disorders, and the risk of developing them is increasing worldwide, particularly in younger people.</li>
<li>Two fundamental experiences can contribute either singly or in combination to all specific mood disorders: a major depressive episode and mania. A less severe episode of mania that does not cause impairment in social or occupational functioning is known as a hypomanic episode. An episode of mania coupled with anxiety or depression is known as a mixed episode or mixed state.</li>
<li>An individual who suffers from episodes of depression only is said to have a unipolar disorder. An individual who alternates between depression and mania has a bipolar disorder.</li>

<ul>
<li>Major depressive disorder may be a single episode or recurrent, but it is always time-limited; in another form of depression, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), the symptoms are often somewhat milder but remain relatively unchanged over long periods. In some cases, fewer symptoms are observed than in a major depressive episode, but they persist for at least two years (persistent depressive disorder) (dysthymia); in other cases, a major depressive episode will last at least two years (chronic major depressive episode). In cases of double depression, a form of persistent depressive disorder, an individual experiences both major depressive episodes and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia).</li>
<li>Approximately 20% of bereaved individuals may experience a complicated grief reaction in which the normal grief response develops into a full-blown mood disorder.</li>
<li>The key identifying feature of bipolar disorders is an alternation of manic episodes and major depressive episodes. Cyclothymic disorder is a milder but more chronic version of bipolar disorder.</li>
<li>Patterns of additional features that sometimes accompany mood disorders, called specifiers, may predict the course or patient response to treatment, as does the temporal patterning or course of mood disorders. One pattern, seasonal affective disorder, most often occurs in winter.</li>

<ul>
<li>Mood disorders in children are fundamentally similar to mood disorders in adults.</li>
<li>Symptoms of depression are increasing dramatically in our elderly population.</li>
<li>The experience of anxiety across cultures varies, and it can be difficult to make comparisons&#x2014;especially, for example, when we attempt to compare subjective feelings of depression.</li>

<ul>
<li>The causes of mood disorders lie in a complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors. From a biological perspective, researchers are particularly interested in the stress hypothesis and the role of neuro-hormones. Psychological theories of depression focus on learned helplessness and the depressive cognitive schemas, as well as interpersonal disruptions.</li>

<ul>
<li>A variety of treatments, both biological and psychological, have proved effective for the mood disorders, at least in the short term. For those individuals who do not respond to antidepressant drugs or psychosocial treatments, a more dramatic physical treatment, electroconvulsive therapy, is sometimes used. Two psychological treatments&#x2014;cognitive therapy and interpersonal psycho-therapy&#x2014;seem effective in treating depressive disorders.</li>
<li>Relapse and recurrence of mood disorders are common in the long term, and treatment efforts must focus on maintenance treatment, that is, on preventing relapse or recurrence.</li>

<ul>
<li>Suicide is often associated with mood disorders but can occur in their absence or in the presence of other disorders. It is the 10th leading cause of death among all people in the United States, but among adolescents, it is the 3rd leading cause of death.</li>
<li>In understanding suicidal behavior, three indices are important: suicidal ideation (serious thoughts about committing suicide), suicidal plans (a detailed method for killing oneself), and suicidal attempts (that are not successful). Important, too, in learning about risk factors for suicides is the psychological autopsy, in which the psychological profile of an individual who has committed suicide is reconstructed and examined for clues.</li>

<ul>
<li>Anxiety is a future-oriented state characterized by negative affect in which a person focuses on the possibility of uncontrollable danger or misfortune; in contrast, fear is a present-oriented state characterized by strong escapist tendencies and a surge in the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system in response to current danger.</li>
<li>A panic attack represents the alarm response of real fear, but there is no actual danger.</li>
<li>Panic attacks may be (1) unexpected (without warning), or (2) expected (always occurring in a specific situation).</li>

<ul>
<li>In generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), anxiety focuses on minor, everyday events and not on one major worry or concern.</li>
<li>Both genetic and psychological vulnerabilities seem to contribute to the development of GAD.</li>
<li>Although drug and psychological treatments may be effective in the short term, drug treatments are no more effective in the long term than placebo treatments. Successful treatment may help individuals with GAD focus on what is really threatening to them in their lives.</li>

<ul>
<li>In panic disorder, which may or may not be accompanied by agoraphobia (a fear and avoidance of situations considered to be &#x201C;unsafe&#x201D;), anxiety is focused on the next panic attack. For some people, agoraphobia develops in the absence of panic attacks or panic-like symptoms.</li>
<li>We all have some genetic vulnerability to stress, and many of us have had a neurobiological overreaction to some stressful event&#x2014;that is, a panic attack. Individuals who develop panic disorder and then develop anxiety over the possibility of having another panic attack.</li>
<li>Both drug and psychological treatments have proved successful in the treatment of panic disorder. One psychological method, panic control treatment, concentrates on exposing patients to clusters of sensations that remind them of their panic attacks. For agoraphobia, therapeutically-supervised exposure to feared situations is most effective.</li>
